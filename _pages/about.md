I am an Assistant Professor at [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home), [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en), working in the Information Processing and Communications Laboratory (LTCI) in the Multimedia team. My research interests include the fundamentals and applications of **Geometric Deep Learning** (Graph and Simplicial Neural Networks), **Computer Vision**, **Machine Learning**, and **Graph Signal Processing**.

I received my Ph.D. in applied mathematics at La Rochelle Université, Laboratoire MIA (Mathématiques, Image, et Applications), France in 2022. During my Ph.D. studies I was a visiting Ph.D. student at Centre de Vision Numérique (CVN), Inria OPIS at CentraleSupélec, Université Paris-Saclay, France in 2022.
