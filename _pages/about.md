I am an Assistant Professor at [TÃ©lÃ©com Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home), [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en), working in the Information Processing and Communications Laboratory (LTCI) in the Multimedia team. I'm a member of the [ELLIS Society](https://ellis.eu/) and the [IEEE Signal Processing Society](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/).

My research focuses on the theory and applications of **Geometric Deep Learning** (graph and higher-order networks), **Computer Vision**, **Machine Learning**, and **Graph Signal Processing**.

I received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from La Rochelle UniversitÃ© (Laboratoire MIA â€“ MathÃ©matiques, Image et Applications) in 2022. During my Ph.D., I was a visiting researcher at the Centre de Vision NumÃ©rique (CVN) and Inria OPIS, CentraleSupÃ©lec, UniversitÃ© Paris-Saclay (2022), and at the CVPR Lab, UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Napoli Parthenope, Italy (2021).

Before my doctoral studies, I worked as a Research Assistant at the University of Delaware, USA (2018â€“2019), focusing on Graph Signal Processing. I hold both a Masterâ€™s degree (with honors, 2018) and a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronics Engineering (2016) from Universidad de Antioquia, Colombia.

ðŸ“¢ **Call for Research Internship with Possibility of a PhD (2025â€“2026):** We are looking for motivated students to join our project on Compression and Efficient Processing of Graph Data at TÃ©lÃ©com Paris, in collaboration with TÃ©lÃ©com SudParis and the University of Southern California (Prof. Antonio Ortega). The internship starts in Spring 2026 and may lead to a PhD opportunity for outstanding candidates. More details [here](https://github.com/jhonygiraldo/jhonygiraldo.github.io/blob/main/assets/pdf/Telecom_USC_Internship.pdf).

ðŸ“¢ **Call for Internships 2025-2026:** I am looking for motivated students interested in **geometric deep learning** for internships starting in spring 2026.

ðŸŽ“ **For M1 and M2 students at IP Paris:** I am happy to supervise a limited number of masterâ€™s projects. Please note that I expect you to be enrolled in my course *Machine Learning with Graphs* (APM_5DS30_TP).
