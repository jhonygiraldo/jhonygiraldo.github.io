I am an Assistant Professor at [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home), [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en), working in the Information Processing and Communications Laboratory (LTCI) in the Multimedia team. My research interests include the fundamentals and applications of Geometric Deep Learning (Graph and Simplicial Neural Networks), Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Graph Signal Processing. I have worked on image and video processing, supervised and semi-supervised learning, and sampling and reconstruction of graph signals.

I received my Ph.D. in applied mathematics at La Rochelle Université, Laboratoire MIA (Mathématiques, Image, et Applications), France in 2022. During my Ph.D. studies I was a visiting Ph.D. student at Centre de Vision Numérique (CVN), Inria OPIS at CentraleSupélec, Université Paris-Saclay, France in 2022. I was also a visiting scholar at the Università degli Studi di Napoli Parthenope, Italy, working at the CVPR Lab “Alfredo Petrosino” in 2021.

Before my Ph.D. studies, I spent 15 months at the University of Delaware, USA, between 2018 and 2019, working on Graph Signal Processing as a Research Assistant. I received a Master of Science degree with honors in 2018 from the Universidad de Antioquia, Colombia, and a Bachelor in Electronics Engineering at the same university in 2016.
